>   We are working for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
  The company wants to understand the strong indicators driving  loan defaults. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- The company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

- When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:  
- Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, follwing are the scenarios:
	*  Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan.
	* Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed.
	* Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan.  </p>
	* Loan rejected:The company had rejected the loan because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.

#### Dataset:
Dataset is a .csv file containing information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
The analysis will not consider consumer variables since they were not available at the time of loan application. 
Rejected loans will not be a part of analysis since there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company.
